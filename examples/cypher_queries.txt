## Useful Cypher queries for Neo4j Database


#### Return a list with the name of all activities
```
MATCH (n:Activity) RETURN n.name
```
#### Return a list with the name of all entities
```
MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN n.name
```
#### Return a count of all activities
```
MATCH (n:Activity) RETURN count(n)
```
#### Return a count of all entities
```
MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN count(n)
```
#### Return ratio of activities to entity
```
MATCH (n:Activity) WITH toFloat(count(n)) as num MATCH (m:Entity) RETURN num/count(m)
```
#### Use known annotation/property value to find a particular node
```
MATCH (n {annotationName:"VALUE"}) RETURN n
```
or
```
MATCH (n) WHERE annotationName = "VALUE" RETURN n
```
Example - display all activities, entities, and their relationships stemming from a given user
```
MATCH p = (n {createdBy: "#######"})<-[*]-(m) RETURN DISTINCT p, collect(m)
```

#### Who is generating the most activity
```
START n = node(*) 
MATCH (n)--(c) WHERE EXISTS(n.createdBy)
RETURN n.createdBy, count(*) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Display all provenance leading back to origin
```
MATCH p = (n {synId:”#######”})<-[*]-(m) RETURN DISTINCT p
```

#### Display the top ten node of highest degree
```
START n = node(*) 
MATCH (n)--(c)
RETURN n.name, n.synId, count(*) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Display the most used entity/activity
```
START n = node(*) 
MATCH (n)<--(c)
RETURN n.name, n.synId, count(*) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Display the most dependent entity/activity
```
START n = node(*) 
MATCH (n)-->(c)
RETURN n.name, n.synId, count(*) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Poor man’s recommendation engine
```
MATCH (n {createdBy:"YourOriginalID"})-->(c)
MATCH (m)-->(c) WHERE NOT m.createdBy = "YourOriginalID"
WITH m.createdBy as cb
RETURN DISTINCT cb, count(cb) as friendship
ORDER by friendship DESC
LIMIT 10
```
##### Take top result (or another of your choice)
```
MATCH (a {createdBy:"YourOriginalID"})-->(m)
MATCH (b {createdBy: "YourChoiceID"})-->(n) WHERE NOT m=n
WITH a,n
MATCH p = shortestPath((a)--(n))
RETURN n.name, n.synId, length(p)
ORDER BY length(p) LIMIT 3
```
### More detailed examples:

#### Return a list of synIds for every file derived from PCBC protocols not involving Aravind Ramakrishnan as the originating scientist that possess the particular annotation "Diffname_short"
```
MATCH (protocol {fileType:"protocol", projectId:"1773109.0"}) WHERE NOT protocol.Originating_Scientist = "Aravind Ramakrishnan" AND EXISTS(protocol.Diffname_short) WITH collect(protocol) as prots
UNWIND prots as prot
   MATCH (n {synId:prot.synId})<-[*]-(m:Entity) WHERE NOT (m)<-[*]-() AND m.projectId = m.benefactorId AND exists(m.Originating_Lab)
   RETURN n.synId AS parent_id, count(distinct m.synId) AS derived_files
```

#### Return a list of all files within PsychEncode which similarly used BWA alignment tool downloaded from SourceForge, ordered alphanumerically by their synId 
```
MATCH (n {projectId:"4921369.0", fileType:"bam"})-[r]-(s)-[t]->(m {name:"http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwa-0.6.2.tar.bz2/download"}) RETURN DISTINCT n.name, n.synId AS synId ORDER BY synId DESC
```


Feel free to add or suggest other queries that would be equally useful or simply interesting. Queries can also be written programmatically using the Py2neo client library. An example of this can be found here: https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/PsychENCODE/tree/master/dataReleases/aug2016
